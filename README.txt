Sai Ashray FireCreackers - Static website template
Generated from uploaded products file: 5107fbe0-e3eb-44a3-870e-9a962300710a.txt

How it works:
- Open index.html in a browser (double-click) to view the shop.
- All products are loaded from products.js (generated from your uploaded .txt).
- You can select categories, add quantities, and checkout.
- On Confirm, WhatsApp opens to seller number 8262871647 with a prefilled message.

Files:
- index.html, styles.css, app.js, products.js, firecracker.png

Note:
- This is a static site (no server). WhatsApp link opens in browser and user must press Send.
- You asked me to include mandatory fields â€” the checkout form requires Name, Mobile, WhatsApp, Address, and age confirmation.
- I used a flat 10% discount for display. The cart uses discounted prices.
